# Transitioning from R to Go

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the feasibility and benefits of transitioning from R to Go for the consulting firm, which has been using R extensively for data analysis and modeling. The focus is on assessing the ease of use, performance improvement, and potential cloud computing cost savings by adopting Go, especially for large-scale data processing tasks.

## Background
- **Current Usage**: R, with extensive reliance on the Comprehensive R Archive Network for modeling and data analysis.
- **Consideration**: Moving to Go for its performance advantages and efficient utilization of modern multi-core processors.

## Objective
- Evaluate the ease of use of Go as a replacement for R in the firm's workflow.
- Compare the performance and efficiency of Go versus R in handling large data sets.
- Estimate potential savings in cloud computing costs when transitioning to Go.

## Methodology

### Comparative Analysis
- Implemented overparameterized models in both R and Go.
- Performed benchmarking to compare execution times and resource utilization.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **R**: `keras` package for neural network implementation.
- **Go**: `gorgonia` library for equivalent neural network architecture.

### Benchmarking Approach
- Measured execution times and memory usage for both R and Go implementations.
- Used `microbenchmark` in R and Go's built-in testing framework for benchmarking.

## Results and Findings

### Ease of Use
- R offers a more user-friendly environment for data scientists, with extensive libraries and community support.
- Go, while not traditionally used in data science, provides robust performance and is well-suited for scalable applications.

### Performance Comparison
- Go implementation demonstrated superior performance in terms of execution speed and efficiency.
- Memory management in Go was more effective, reducing the overall computational resource requirement.

### Cloud Computing Cost Implications
- Improved performance in Go can lead to shorter processing times on cloud platforms, potentially reducing costs associated with compute resources.
- Memory efficiency in Go can further contribute to cost savings, especially when dealing with large data sets.

## Recommendations

- **For High-Performance Needs**: Adopt Go for tasks that require high computational efficiency and handle large data sets.
- **For Rapid Development and Prototyping**: Continue using R for tasks that benefit from its extensive libraries and ease of use.
- **Training and Skill Development**: Invest in training for data scientists to bridge the gap in Go's learning curve.

## Cost Savings Estimate
- A rough estimate suggests a potential reduction of 15% in cloud computing costs, subject to the specific use cases and cloud pricing models.

## Conclusion
Transitioning some of the data processing tasks from R to Go could be beneficial for the consulting firm, especially in scenarios where performance and efficiency are critical. The decision should be aligned with the firm's specific needs, considering both the technical and financial aspects.
